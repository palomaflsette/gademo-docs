# User Guide


This section serves as a practical guide to assist users in exploring the full capabilities of the GADEMO platform. It is designed to provide step-by-step explanations of the graphical interface, input parameters, and analytical features offered throughout the tool.

The guide is structured to help both novice and advanced users understand how to navigate the system, configure experiments, interpret visual outputs, and extract meaningful insights from the results obtained.

Among the features covered are: the parameter configuration panel, the numeric keyboard for expression entry, visual indicators of population performance (e.g., average fitness plots, box plots, and best individual tracking), and more advanced elements such as the distribution of fitness in the last generation and the conceptual analytical execution mode.

By following this guide, users will be equipped with the necessary knowledge to confidently run their own experiments, evaluate genetic algorithm behaviors, and leverage the GADEMO interface as an educational and analytical platform for evolutionary computation.
