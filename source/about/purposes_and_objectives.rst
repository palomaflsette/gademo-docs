Purposes And Objectives
************************

The primary purpose of GADEMO is to facilitate the understanding and application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) through an interactive and visually engaging platform.

Its objectives include:

- **Educational Enhancement**  
  Provide a practical tool for students and educators to explore key concepts in evolutionary computation without the need for complex coding.

- **Conceptual Visualization**  
  Illustrate the internal mechanisms of GAs — such as selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness — in a dynamic and comprehensible way.

- **Accessibility**  
  Deliver a fully web-based solution that can be accessed from any device, anywhere, eliminating installation barriers.

- **Experimentation Support**  
  Allow users to design and execute experiments by adjusting algorithmic parameters and analyzing the outcomes across generations.

- **Research Integration**  
  Serve as a base for future academic research, enabling extensions, case studies, and data collection through its API.

The tool was designed with both pedagogical and scientific intentions, acting as a bridge between theoretical learning and empirical analysis in the field of Genetic Algorithms.
