GADemo Overview
****************

GADEMO (Genetic Algorithm Demonstrator Online) is an interactive educational platform developed to support the teaching and understanding of Genetic Algorithms (GA) through a user-friendly and highly visual graphical interface. The application is designed for students, educators, and researchers who wish to explore the fundamentals of GAs in a practical and intuitive manner, building a bridge between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. With GADEMO, users can observe the dynamics of population evolution, analyze detailed statistics, and conduct experiments without the need for programming or setting up complex technical environments.

The platform is fully web-based and accessible from any device with internet access. Its development is the result of an academic collaboration committed to innovation in the teaching of computational intelligence, supported by experienced professors and researchers in the field.
