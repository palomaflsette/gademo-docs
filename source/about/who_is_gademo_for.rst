Who is GADemo For?
*******************

GADEMO was designed to serve a broad audience interested in the study and application of Genetic Algorithms. Its primary focus is on educational contexts, making it an especially valuable tool for:

- Undergraduate and graduate students beginning their studies in computational intelligence, optimization, or related fields, who wish to visualize theoretical concepts in a practical and interactive manner.

- Teachers and educators, who can use GADEMO as a didactic resource to demonstrate in real time how genetic algorithms work and how different parameters influence the evolutionary process.

- Researchers and enthusiasts, seeking to explore early ideas, conduct simple simulations, or introduce newcomers to the evolutionary logic behind GAs.

The platform is accessible and intuitive, allowing users without prior programming experience to interact with the algorithms, understand their behaviors, and visually analyze the outcomes.
