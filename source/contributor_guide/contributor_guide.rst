Contributions Welcome From All Areas
====================================

GADemo is an open web platform for demonstrating **Genetic Algorithms**, with both a Python backend and a pure **JavaScript/CSS/HTML frontend**. Whether you're a backend developer, a frontend designer, a data science enthusiast, or a documentation wizard â€” there's space for your contribution here.

ðŸ§  Backend (Python - DEAP based)
---------------------------------

- New selection methods and fitness evaluation modes;
- Performance optimization and parallelism;
- API refactoring, testing, or validation improvements;
- etc.

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
---------------------------------

- Improving the **user experience (UX)**
- Designing more intuitive **visualizations** for genetic algorithm outputs
- Adding interactivity or tooltips in charts
- Refining **responsiveness** and accessibility (mobile, keyboard nav, etc.)
- Suggesting or implementing **new UI components**
- etc.

Don't worry if you're not a "full-stack" person â€” **every small contribution helps**.

Development Workflow
====================

To maintain the consistency and quality of the project, we ask all contributors to follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork and Clone** the project repository (to be published soon).
2. Create a **branch** with a meaningful name:  
   e.g., ``frontend-redesign-dashboard`` or ``feature-log-execution``.
3. Follow consistent **coding styles**:
   
   - **Python**: Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
   - **HTML/CSS/JS**: Clean, semantic, and well-indented code is preferred
  
4. Add clear **comments**, **docstrings**, and **descriptive commits**.
5. Submit a **pull request** with a concise summary of the changes made.
