# Examples


This section provides **practical examples** of how to use GADEMO in different contexts. Its purpose is to showcase the platform's flexibility and robustness through real optimization tasks.

Two main approaches are presented:

- **Using GADEMO for Function Optimization**: Demonstrates the platform in action with well-known benchmark functions used in the literature. These examples help illustrate the impact of different parameters on the convergence behavior and final results.
- **Analytical Execution: A Conceptual Demonstration**: Offers a structured, step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm evolves in a single controlled execution. This is especially useful for educational purposes or for those interested in understanding the algorithmic flow in more depth.
